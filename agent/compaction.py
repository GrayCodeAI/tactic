"""History compaction for the proof repair loop
(ports tau's ContextCompactor to the deterministic, provider-free case).

The loop keeps the LLM history bounded, but naive truncation throws away
everything the model already tried — so weak models ping-pong between the
same dead ends for 20 steps. Instead (tau's rule: summarize what was
already covered, keep recent context verbatim), compact_history() folds
older user/assistant turns into one summary turn listing the distinct
failed attempts and their first error, then keeps the most recent turns
intact.
